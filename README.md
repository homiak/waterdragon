# Draigh-uisge means in Scottish Gaelic a Water Dragon.

**Water Dragons:** This mod introduces three types of Dragons — the Pure Water Dragon, the Rare Water Dragon, and the Scottish Dragon. Each has some unique abilities, such as creating healing water and glowing at night.

**Useful things:** Water Dragons can rescue players in danger. There are also many craftitems to discover — some of them are quite special, like the one that lets you talk to Water Dragons.

**Draconic Blocks:** The mod features various decorative and functional blocks, including Draconic Bricks, Draconic Stone, and more.

**Water-Forged Draconic Tools and Armour:** Forge powerful gear from Water-Forged Draconic Steel. The armour offers great protection in battles, and the tools — forged in Dragon Water — are incredibly powerful, capable of killing some enemies in a single hit.
