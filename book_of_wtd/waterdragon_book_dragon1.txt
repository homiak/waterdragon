Chapter 1: Water Dragons

Water Dragons are mysterious and 
elusive creatures of Water Nests.
With immense size and power,
these Dragons command respect
from all who dwell in the
aquatic realms. Unlike their
fire-breathing cousins,
Water Dragons are masters of
controlling the vast bodies of
water around them.
