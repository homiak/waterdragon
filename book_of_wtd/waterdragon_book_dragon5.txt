If you want a Scottish Dragon,
you must find one, then climb 
on it and not get off. You must 
have 10 meat in your hand to tame it.
Just remain seated and wait.
If you tame one, it will be about 
the same as the others, only it will 
not breathe water and will be able to 
dive. Keep in mind: if you forbid 
it to fly, it will not be able to attack.
