If you press
Forward, the Water Dragon will walk. If you
press the right mouse button, it will attack
from the ground. If you press the right mouse
button and go backward, it will create wind
with its powerful wings. If
you press the jump button, it will take off.
If you hold the left mouse button, it will
breathe water. If you hold the left mouse button 
and fly towards a wall, the Water Dragon will
destroy it. If you just fly towards a wall, the
Water Dragon will cling on it. To stop clinging,
just press Space, or jump. If you go backward
the Water Dragon will go down or land. You can
also use A and D keys for walking.
