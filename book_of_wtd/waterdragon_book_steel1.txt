Chapter 2: Draconic Steel

A rare material, forged in 
Dragon Water. Tools of this metal 
have strange qualities and 
immense power. The metal is 
somehow linked to the Water Dragon 
that forged it, and gains 
strength with proximity to said 
Water Dragon. Inversely, if the Water Dragon 
dies, any metal made forged by 
it will shatter upon use.
