Building a Forge requires a 
material hardened against the 
strength of a Water Dragon's 
powerful breath attacks. The 
go-to blueprint requires 
Dragonstone Blocks for the 
frame and core, as well as 
Dragonstone Bricks for the 
outer shell. Dragonstone Blocks 
are created by dropping a stack
of stone or cobble and using
a Water Dragon's breath on it
