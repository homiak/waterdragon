Once your Forge and Crucible 
are ready, gather 99 Steel 
Ingots, and put them in the left 
slot of the Forge. Next, put the 
Crucible in the center slot and 
have your Water Dragon breath 
into the Forge. You will see 
excess flames exhausted out 
of the chimney until the 
Crucible is full. Once your 
Crucible is full, you can allow it 
to cool or move it to an Rare Water 
Forge and breath into it with 
an Rare Water Dragon for Rare Water-Forged 
Draconic Steel.
