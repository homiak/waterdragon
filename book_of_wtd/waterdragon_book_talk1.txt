You can also talk with Water 
Dragons. To start a conversation, 
type /talk_dragon when near 
a Dragon. They can answer about 
their health, origins,
power and give wise advice. 
You can command them to "fly", 
"land", "follow", "stay", 
"attack" or "fire" and more. To end 
conversation just say "bye".
Dragons will only fully respond
to their bonded rider.
